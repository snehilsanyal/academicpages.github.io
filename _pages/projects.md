## [**IIT-Guwahati Virtual Presence platform**](https://iitguwahati.github.io/Virtual-Presence-IIT-Guwahati-2020/)<br>


- Used [Gather Town](https://gather.town/) to make up a virtual map for IIT Guwahati, this was during the pandemic when students were not able to join their institute for graduation and farewell.
- The aim was to create a virtual presence experience for the students.
- Was the 2nd institute in India, to conduct a virtual convocation (1st was IIT Bombay), but our map was much refined and bigger
- The map of the institute was created using Autocad and textures were added using Photoshop.
- At a time 500 users can enter the map, the overall event was divided in four slots.
- You can have conversation with your friends play games view objects and videos of different departments.
