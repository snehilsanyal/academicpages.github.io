Hey everyone, this is Snehil. 

I am currently pursusing my PhD from [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in/). I am enrolled as a research scholar with the [EEE Department](https://www.iitg.ac.in/eee/). I joined PhD in 2019 July, under the guidance of [Prof. M. K. Bhuyan](https://iitg.ac.in/mkb/index.php). I work closely with [Dr. Debanga Raj Neog](https://debanga.github.io/), who has recently joined as an Assistant Professor at [Mehta Family School of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.iitg.ac.in/dsai/home) at IIT Guwahati. I am also collaborating with [Iwahori Lab](http://www.cvl.cs.chubu.ac.jp/~iwahori/) for my PhD project on Facial Expression Recognition.

My current research domain revolves around the following (and are not limited to): Facial Expression Recognition, Affective Computing, Graph Representation Learning. In my recent works, I am trying to harness the power of graph based architecture for facial expression recognition. 

## Background

Prior to joining PhD at IIT Guwahati, I completed my masters (M.Tech) from [Defence Institute of Advanced Technology, Pune](https://www.diat.ac.in/) in Robotics. During my 2nd year, I had the opportunity to work in one of the labs of [DRDO](https://www.drdo.gov.in/), [Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](https://www.drdo.gov.in/labs-and-establishments/centre-artificial-intelligence-robotics-cair) (ISRD Division) at Bengaluru. Here, I worked with **Mr. Shashank Bhushan, Scientist 'C'**, CAIR DRDO. My work was based on **Monocular Depth Estimation for drones**. I used [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) for this project.

I received my Bachelor's degree from [National Institute of Technology, Raipur](http://www.nitrr.ac.in/) in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering.

In my free time, I learn and build new things and constantly update my skills. Recently, I have also started contributing (at a very small scale, just began) to Open Source in GitHub. Currently I am learning about Graph Neural Networks and the libraries that implement them like [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Spektral](https://graphneural.network/). I am open for collaborations revolving around my domain (you can drop a text on LinkedIn or my mail). I am actively looking for research internship opportunities or fellowships to aid my research and increase my exposure.
