[Digital Signal Processors Lab]()<br>

<b>Jan-May 2021</b><br>
<b>Mode: Remote/ Discord</b>

I took the Digital Signal Processors lab during Jan-May 2021 session. The mode was virtual because of the second wave of Covid in India. There were 20 students who enrolled. The lab focused on fundamentals of digital signal processing through simple assignments which can be done using Python. Submissions were accepted through GitHub Repository.

This lab was a great experience for me as well as the students, we enjoyed and learned together. All the students who took this course, went on to crack good job offers in their final year. As of now the whole batch is placed in different companies.
